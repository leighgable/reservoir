# ❄️ reservoir computing with jax ⚕️

Minimal **Jax** implementation of **Reservoirs**

</div>

## About

The two toy problems are a sin wave and the lorenz system.

## Run the code

I just ran it in iPython: `%load reservoir.py`.
But you could also run it on the cli with
```bash
python -m reservoir.py
```
The results are pretty shakey, but this is a vanilla
reservoir with only 100 sparse nodes (although they
are recurrent).
